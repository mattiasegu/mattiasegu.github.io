I am a PhD candidate at the Computer Vision Lab at ETH Zurich, jointly supervised by Prof. Luc Van Gool and Prof. Bernt Schiele. As a member of the Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems. I recently visited Bernt Schiele's group at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics. My research interests include learning how to track multiple objects with limited supervision and under adverse conditions. So far, I have worked on domain-adaptive, class-incremental and self-supervised multiple object tracking. Previously, I worked on fundamental deep learning problems such as domain generalization and uncertainty estimation.
