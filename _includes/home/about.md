## About Me
I am a PhD candidate at the [Computer Vision Lab](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich, jointly supervised by Prof. Luc Van Gool and Prof. Bernt Schiele. As a member of the [Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems](https://learning-systems.org/), I recently visited the [Computer Vision and Machine Learning Department](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-machine-learning/) at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics under the supervision of Prof. Bernt Schiele. My research interests include learning how to track multiple objects with limited supervision and under adverse conditions. So far, I have worked on domain-adaptive, class-incremental and self-supervised multiple object tracking. Previously, I worked on fundamental deep learning problems such as domain generalization and uncertainty estimation.
